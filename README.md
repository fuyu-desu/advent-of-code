# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), implemented in C++.

## How to Use

Each solution is a standalone C++ source file that needs to be compiled before execution. The input for each problem should be stored in a separate file.

### Compilation

Compile the C++ file using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`):

```sh
# Example for day-1.cpp
g++ -o a day-1.cpp
```

### Running the Solution

Store the problem input in a file (e.g., `q`), then run the compiled executable while redirecting the input:

#### On Windows:
```sh
a < q
```

#### On Linux/macOS:
```sh
./a < q
```

- `input`: input file
- `README.md`: This documentation.

## Notes

- Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., `g++` for GCC, `clang++`, or MSVC).
- You can change the executable name by modifying the `-o` flag in the compilation command.

Happy coding! ðŸŽ„
